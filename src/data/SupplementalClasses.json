The hardest part of playing a chaos mage may be that you're not going to be able to write all your options down on a character sheet. The price of a rich randomness of spells is that you'll need to keep the book around. The easy part of playing a chaos mage is that you have a limited set of options on any given turn. You don't have to compare more than two or three spell choices each turn, and most of these options have different usage patterns. In some cases the significant decisions you'll make will be how to put yourself in the best position for the spell you're going to cast and then how to use the choices within the spell. Playing a chaos mage won't prepare a newcomer to play any other spellcaster, but new players who enjoy shaping a path out of randomness should have fun. Just be mindful of other players.",
